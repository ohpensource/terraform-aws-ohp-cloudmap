# Example: Simple Cloudmap Namespace, Service & Instance

A very basic example to show how to create a namespace, a service within that namespace and register an instance.

Instance attributes can be added automatically using a map variable.

This is not a particularly efficient use of the modules if need to create many namespaces or services for different client DTAP environments.
